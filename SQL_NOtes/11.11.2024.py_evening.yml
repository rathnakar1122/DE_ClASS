 GCP Data Engineer
*******************:

Session Title: Database Architecture and ACID Properties

Session Duration: 1 Hour

•	Topics Covered:
    o	DBMS architecture and components.
    o	ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and their importance in relational databases.
    
•	Objective: Understand database architecture and transaction handling.

Recap:
 - What is DATA, DATABASE, DBMS, RDBMS, SQL, No-SQL, Warehouse?
 
Interview Questions:
 - What are the other services you worked on from GCP Platform?:
    - Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions and Datafusion
    
 - What is the difference between Cloud SQL and BigTable?:
    - Both are  from the GCP Platform
    - Both are useful Transactional Servers, in other words - both are OLTP Systems
    - Cloud SQL is a RDBMS, BigTable supports No-SQL Database 
   
    
1. DBMS architecture and components.:
 - What is DBMS? 
    - It is a software tool * 
    - It is useful for creating Databases, Storing the data, Managing the Data and retriving Data.

SQL  - It communicates with the databases(MS) -- 

Single- Tier Architecture:
    - In the DBMS world, the one-tier Architecture is the simplest DBMS architecture, in which the client, server, and database are all on the same machine.
    
    - application dierectly interacts with the databases;


One Tier DBMS Architecture is employed whenever:

    - The data isn’t frequently updated.
    - Multiple users aren’t accessing the database.
    - A direct and simple method of modifying or accessing the database is required for application development.

   
Two-Tier Architecture:

User interfaces and application programs are executed on the client side(local machine). 

Query processing and transaction management are handled on the server side(Server Side).


   
Three-Tier Architecture:

DBMS - Core Components:
    - Databse Engine: Manages the data storage, Process, Retrival - BigSize*
    - Query Processor: SQL Commands can be interpreted 
    - Transaction Manager: It ensures the data integrity and manges concurrent operations
    - Storage Manager: Actually handles the data storage, structured organisation and indexing
    - Buffer Manager: Temporarily storing the data in in-memory location - to speed up the data read and writes.
