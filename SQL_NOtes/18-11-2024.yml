 GCP Data Engineer - Demo
*************************: 

Evening Session: Querying in MySQL, BigQuery, Redshift, RDS and Athena
•	Objective: Learn SQL syntax variations across database systems.
    •	Topics Covered:
        o	Basic query differences among MySQL, BigQuery, Redshift, and Athena.
        o	DDL operations and basic querying in these platforms.
o	Hands-on: Practice basic queries in each system.


BigQuery:
---------
@ is a EDW(Enterprise Data Warehouse) from GCP Platform:

@ is a Serverless: 
    - No need of installation, No need of infrastrucure creation and management
    - We can simply focus wriring queries and doing analytics
    
@ Fully Managed Service from GCP:
    - The udpatation and patch work is taken care by cloud provider
    
@ is a OLAP system:

@ High Scalabiity:(Growing):
    - Machines - Query Run [RDS, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Redshift]
    - 1kb - 100 boxes - 1 man - single day - 1$
    - 1mb - 200 boxes - 2 men - single day
    - 1gb - 2000 boxes- 20 men - single day - 20$
    - 1tb
    - 1pb 
    
  - 1gb RAM - 10 gb SSD -- cloud sql instance -[EP, E] --> [Production - Developement - Sandbox]
  - 10 tb - 10Pb - We are ready - BigQuery - Consideration
  - 1 kb - no issue - On Demand 
  - It has got the tremandous engine which handels patabyte-scale datasets efficiently.
  
@ Standard SQL:Legacy SQL:
  - 2009 - Spl SQL Query -- 
  - Standard SQL Support -- ANSI SQL -- BigQuery SQL we call it...
  - NEST is only in Legacy SQL and does not exist in Standard SQL.
    ARRAY_AGG is only in Standard SQL and provides a more flexible, ANSI-compliant alternative.
  - Developer Community is very high in number
  - It is very easy syntax - 
    
@ Semaless Integration:Can be integrated with other gcp cloud services:
  - Target --[BigQuery]
  - Sea - All Streams, lakes, rivers - finally - sea end up
  - BQ integrates with other GCP services easily -- Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, PubSub, Dataflow, Dataproc 
  
@ Real-Time analytics:
  - It supports streaming data insertions [PubSub]
  - It process the near-real-time data and provides the analytics [PubSub]

@ Bigquery ML:(Resources):
  - It is one the BQ resources 
  - BQ leverages the building and training ml models using sql queries
  
@ Data partitioning and Clustering:
  - House Partions
  - Refrigerater Partitions
  - Data Partitions - Data storage - Tables - Split into partitions - segements - Spl storage - 
    We call that storage - collasus - 
  - It does the partitions basing Time Unit Columns - Date - OrderDate - CreationDate
  - Select * from table wehre date = current_date-1;
  - Clusterting is another feature which makes us sorting the data on using string Columns
  - Select * from table where date = current_date-1 and name like '%raja%';
  
@ Federaterd Queries Support:
  - Federated Country - We have all the individual states - CM 
  - Collectively they are united and responsible for the central goverment --
  - Cloud SQL Instance - Bigquery Data - Private IP - Selection
  - You are in bigquery only - but you query the data from Cloud SQL instances[MySQL server]
  - You can join the data from cloud sql instance of mysql with the data in BigQuery
  - Even - Federated Query concepts extends the hand - like you can run the queries data stayed in the cloud storage -- directly -
  - BigTable Support - 
  
@ Cost-Effective:
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model with on-demand queries or flat-rate pricing
  - Auto-scaling - PB Data - no machines increase - query run -- 
  - Cost Analysis -- 
    -- Work --
    -- 100 boxes - single day - 1 man -- 1 $
    -- 200 boxes - double day - 1 man -- 2 $
    -- 100 boxes - single day - 5 men -- 1 $ - Contract - 
    -- 100 gb    - single day - 10 machines - 1$ - pay 
    -- It does not focus on the no machines allocated to run that particular query 
    -- It mainly focuses on the data how much the query is going to be scanned?
    -- You are supposed to be least bothered about how many machines are allocated to finish your job.
    -- Bigquery Charges the customer basing on the data scanned by that query --?
    -- 1gb - 1$
    -- 100 - 100 $
    
@ Security:
    -- Cloud IAM
    -- Data Encriptions
    -- VPC
