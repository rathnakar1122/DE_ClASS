Evening Session: Querying in MySQL, BigQuery, Redshift, RDS and Athena[Analytical Query]
â€¢	Objective: Learn SQL syntax variations across database systems.
    â€¢	Topics Covered:
        o	Basic query differences among MySQL(Cloud SQL, RDS), BigQuery, Redshift, and Athena.
        o	DDL operations and basic querying in these platforms.
o	Hands-on: Practice basic queries in each system.

MySQL, RDS, Cloud SQL, BigQuery(Architecture), Redshift(Architecture) >> Datatypes:(IMP):

Cluster (Pre-defined Compute Resources):
@ A Redshift Cluster is a collection of one or more compute nodes.
@ It contains pre-defined resources like CPUs, memory, and storage.
@ All nodes in a cluster work together to process queries. 
@ The cluster includes a leader node and one or more compute nodes.


Serverless:[AWS-RS,GCP-BQ]:
@ Redshift Serverless eliminates the need to manage infrastructure.
@ It allows users to run analytics without configuring or managing clusters.[dremel]*
@ AWS automatically provisions resources based on the workload, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency.


Namespace Info:
@ Namespace is a collection of database objects and users. 
@ Data properties include database name and password, permissions, and encryption and security.
@ A namespace in Redshift Serverless isolates resources (databases, users, and workgroups).
@ It acts as a boundary for managing access to Redshift resources.


Workgroup Info:[COMPUTE ENGINES/compute resources]:[aws CLOUD]:
@ Workgroup is a collection of compute resources from which an endpoint is created. 
@ Compute properties include network and security settings.
@ A workgroup defines a set of compute resources and connection properties for Redshift Serverless.
@ It determines how a namespace is accessed and managed, including scaling configurations and permissions.


Database:[Project]:
A Redshift Database is a logical container that stores schema, tables, views, and functions.
It organizes data and provides an environment for SQL operations.

create database test;

Schema:[Dataset]:
@ A schema is a namespace within a Redshift database.
@ It organizes tables, views, and other database objects.
@ It helps avoid name conflicts and improves manageability of large databases.

create schema test.non_public;


Table - Create, Alter, and Drop:
    A table is a structured set of data in rows and columns.
    DDL Family:
        CREATE: Defines a new table with specific columns and data types.
        
        create table test.non_public.customer_info(
            customer_id int,
            cusotmer_name varchar(100)
            )
            
            
        ALTER: Modifies an existing table by adding, changing, or removing columns.
        DROP: Deletes a table and all its data permanently.
    
    DML Family:
        INSERT:
        
        insert into test.non_public.customer_info(customer_id, cusotmer_name)
        values (12, 'Raja');
        
        SELECT:
        
        select * from test.non_public.customer_info;
        

View:
    @ A view is a virtual table created by a query.
    @ It does not store data physically but provides a way to access specific data subsets.
    @ Views simplify complex queries and enhance data security by restricting access to underlying tables.

Function:
    @ A function in Redshift is a reusable piece of SQL code.
    @ It can be used to perform operations like calculations or data transformations.
    @ Functions can be user-defined (UDFs) or system-defined.


Stored Procedure:
   @ running multiple sql statements
